# Security and Privacy Guide

## SQL Injection Protection

Our login system implements several layers of defense against SQL injection attacks:

### Current Implementation

1. **Input Sanitization**
   - All user inputs are sanitized using `mysqli_real_escape_string()` which escapes special characters in strings used in SQL statements

2. **Database Connection Security**
   - Database credentials are stored securely in configuration files
   - Connection uses minimal required privileges for operation

### Enhanced Protection (Implemented)

To further strengthen security against SQL injection, the following measures have been implemented:

1. **Prepared Statements**
   - All database queries now use prepared statements with parameterized queries
   - Example:
     ```php
     // Instead of:
     $email = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['email']);
     $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='$email'";
     
     // We now use:
     $stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?");
     $stmt->bind_param("s", $email);
     $stmt->execute();
     $result = $stmt->get_result();
     ```

2. **Input Validation**
   - Email addresses are validated using filter_var with FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL
   - Password complexity requirements are enforced before processing
   - All form inputs have appropriate length and format validation

3. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Custom error handlers prevent exposure of sensitive database information
   - Errors are logged securely without revealing implementation details to users
   - Failed login attempts are logged with timestamps and IP addresses

## Additional Security Measures

1. **Password Protection**
   - Passwords are hashed using PHP's `password_hash()` function with bcrypt algorithm
   - Unique salts are automatically generated for each password
   - No plaintext passwords are stored in the database

2. **Session Security**
   - Sessions have configurable timeout periods
   - Session IDs are regenerated after login to prevent session fixation attacks
   - HTTP-only and secure flags are set on cookies when HTTPS is available
   - Sessions are properly destroyed at logout

3. **XSS Prevention**
   - All output to the browser is sanitized using `htmlspecialchars()`
   - Content Security Policy headers restrict execution of inline scripts
   - Input validation reduces the risk of stored XSS attacks

4. **CSRF Protection**
   - CSRF tokens are generated and validated for all forms
   - Tokens are unique per session and expire after use
   - Example implementation:
     ```php
     // Generate token
     $_SESSION['csrf_token'] = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));
     
     // In form
     <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="<?php echo $_SESSION['csrf_token']; ?>">
     
     // Validate
     if (!hash_equals($_SESSION['csrf_token'], $_POST['csrf_token'])) {
         die("CSRF attack detected");
     }
     ```

## Privacy Considerations

1. **Data Collection**
   - Only essential user information is collected during registration
   - Clear privacy policy explains how user data is used

2. **Data Storage**
   - Personal information is stored securely with appropriate encryption
   - Database servers are protected with firewalls and access controls

3. **User Control**
   - Users can update or delete their account information
   - Account deletion process permanently removes user data

## Security Testing

1. **Regular Audits**
   - Code is periodically reviewed for security vulnerabilities
   - Dependency scanning identifies outdated or vulnerable libraries

2. **Penetration Testing**
   - Regular testing attempts to identify potential security weaknesses
   - Both automated and manual testing approaches are used

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Security Roadmap

Future security enhancements planned:

1. Implementation of rate limiting for login attempts
2. Two-factor authentication options
3. Security headers optimization (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
4. Regular security training for development team members
